Abaqus-script-for-diamond-shaped-pressurized-plate
==================================================

This code consists of a series of nested FOR loops which iterate through the various model parameters, compute the shape of the bladder segment, mesh the segment, apply the load, and submit the simulation. The results of each run of the simulation are written to a unique .ODB 


The scripting used here is modeled after the process described by Kevin Maxwell at Texas A&M University: http://goo.gl/wbaiB
